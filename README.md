DAPHT
=====

Document and Archive Payload Hidding Tool (DAPHT) is a penetration testing tool for embedding various
executables and scripts in documents and archives, in order to hide them from email and web filtering products.

The intention is to use this with MailFEET and WebFEET for auditing filtering solutions, but this tool may have other
uses including creating payloads for client-side attacks.
